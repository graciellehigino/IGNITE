# Roadmap 🗺️  

Here you can easily find tasks to be done and keep track of the project development. You don't need to follow any order: you can help in any task you feel comfortable with.  
And most importantly: **don't forget to have _TONS_ of fun!**  
>*Also, don't forget to read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)* :wink:

### Surveys  
We need two surveys: one to find out scientists' needs on SciComm training, and another one to assess how they are doing after the workshop.  
- [ ] [Pre-workshop survey](https://github.com/graciellehigino/IGNITE/issues/1)  
- [ ] Post-workshop survey  

### Content  
The basic workshop will be composed by 6 lessons:  
- [ ] [Communication basics](https://github.com/graciellehigino/IGNITE/issues/7)  
- [ ] Writing  
- [ ] Audio  
- [ ] Videos  
- [ ] Images  
- [ ] Talks  

Translated material is also important. If you need the material translated in a language not listed in here, you can open an Issue and we will try to find someone to help.  
- [ ] Portuguese  
- [ ] French  
- [ ] German  
- [ ] Spanish  
- [ ] Italian  
- [ ] Chinese

### Funding  
The basic workshop do not need funding. But it is good to know where to ask for money if you need. We will gather information about potentianl funders so you can always take a look at their open calls.

### Collaborators  
It is always good to count on experts! In this list we will gather information on experts who volunteered to help on the lessons during the workshops.

### Visual identity  
Once the project is up and running, we will need some visual identity to reach a greater number of people.  
- [ ] [Visual identity](https://github.com/graciellehigino/IGNITE/issues/5)  
 
It also includes some templates, such as the ones used in the lessons.
- [ ] [Slides templates](https://github.com/graciellehigino/IGNITE/issues/4)

### Website  
We will also need a website (a [GitHub page](https://pages.github.com/)) to make it easier for users to find and explore our material.  
- [ ] Website  

That's basically it! You can find details on each task (and subtasks) on corresponding issues. Don't hesitate to ask for help, and, once again: **have fun!**
